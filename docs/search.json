    "text": "Jeffrey recently graduated with his Master of Public Health degree in Infectious Disease Epidemiology from Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. Prior to entering my Master program, Jeffrey had an honor to serve as an emergency medical technician for six months for conscription in Taiwan. Jeffrey gained significant training in emergency responses and communications.\nJeffrey’s interest in epidemiology was sparked during my junior year of college, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world grappled with a global health crisis, Jeffrey became fascinated by how infectious diseases spread and how public health strategies could mitigate their impact. This curiosity led him to immerse himself in a diverse range of microbiology and epidemiology courses, which not only deepened his understanding of disease patterns but also ignited a passion for applying these concepts to real-world challenges.\nJeffrey further honed his epidemiologic skills through a research project that examined the mental health experiences of college students, where he gained firsthand experience in data collection and analysis. As an international student studying Biology with a focus on infectious diseases and health determinants, He recognized the importance of additional epidemiological training in addressing complex health issues across populations. This academic journey solidified his commitment to pursuing epidemiology as a career."

It’s a small, yet beautiful island country with a population of approximately 23 million people, neighboring to Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and the People Republic of China (PRC).\n\n\nI grew up in Taipei which is the capital of Taiwan. The city is known for its night market and cuisine, in addition to being the heart of everything. The common languages are predominantly spoken in Mandarin and English, with a slight mixture of Taiwanese, Hakka, and aboriginal languages. The Hoklo Taiwanese which is the predominant ethnic group I classify as. My ancestors are several generations of Hoklo Taiwanese even before 1949 when the Republic of China whose party was called the Nationalist Party lost the war against the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSomething\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
