## Hi...**Jeffrey** here from Taipei, Taiwan:taiwan:

::: {#hero-heading}
Jeffrey recently graduated with his Master of Public Health degree in Infectious Disease Epidemiology from Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. Prior to entering my Master program, Jeffrey had an honor to serve as an emergency medical technician for six months for conscription in Taiwan. Jeffrey gained significant training in emergency responses and communications.

Jeffrey's interest in epidemiology was sparked during my junior year of college, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world grappled with a global health crisis, Jeffrey became fascinated by how infectious diseases spread and how public health strategies could mitigate their impact. This curiosity led him to immerse himself in a diverse range of microbiology and epidemiology courses, which not only deepened his understanding of disease patterns but also ignited a passion for applying these concepts to real-world challenges.

Jeffrey further honed his epidemiologic skills through a research project that examined the mental health experiences of college students, where he gained firsthand experience in data collection and analysis. As an international student studying Biology with a focus on infectious diseases and health determinants, He recognized the importance of additional epidemiological training in addressing complex health issues across populations. This academic journey solidified his commitment to pursuing epidemiology as a career.
